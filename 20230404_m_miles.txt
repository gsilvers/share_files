1 Notes from Python Code
════════════════════════

1.1 Syntax / Structure
──────────────────────

  (-) In a few places like here
  <https://gitlab.com/michaelmiles/healthverity-python-demo/-/blob/main/scripts/modules/mod/mod.py#L11>
  we’re importing pandas locally in a function. This is valid you “can”
  do it but its generally more accepted to simply import the dependency
  at the top of the file once.

  (+) looks like you understand pandas well even if you do not like it.

  (+) while probably not required for something like this I appreciate
  the split files/modules for the modification vs retrieval functions.

  (/) not really needed for this kind of project but unlike R python has
  some conventions about communicating types of function arguments. Here
  for example
  <https://gitlab.com/michaelmiles/healthverity-python-demo>/-/blob/main/scripts/modules/mod/mod.py#L30
  its pretty unclear what type valid_procedure is. I can sort of infer
  its a dataframe from the rest of the code but that’s not super clear
  at first glance. Python allows for docstrings or basically a function
  description string OR type annotation in the function definition to
  make these more clear. Both are popular to use on bigger projects.
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html> or
  <https://peps.python.org/pep-0257>/.


1.2 Overall notes
─────────────────

  This is overall good code. Even though you’re not doing python day to
  day you have Pandas down. A few tips on just syntax formalities but in
  terms of how you broke down your code and are using pandas to answer
  the questions it looks all good.

  I’m not sure how that team will see the pytest thing but aside from
  that I think it should be set.
